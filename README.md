# Commute Mitra
---

Commute Mitra is a Python-based tool for managing and analyzing commute data. It allows users to input commute information, performs data organization and analysis, and generates visualizations to gain insights into commuting patterns.

## Features
---

- **Interactive Data Entry**: Users can input commute data interactively, including location, mode of transportation, commute time, and distance traveled.

- **Data Organization**: Commute data is organized into DataFrames, allowing for easy manipulation and analysis.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and range are calculated for commute time and distance traveled using NumPy.

- **Data Visualization**: Various visualizations, including bar charts and stacked bar charts, are generated using matplotlib to visualize location counts, mode counts, average commute time by location and mode, and mode usage distribution by location.
